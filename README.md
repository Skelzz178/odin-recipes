# odin-recipes

A simple page which directs to the recipes of 3 of my favourite food

What I've learned from this Project:

- How to set up a basic html webpage structure
- How to create links between pages
- How to display images on the webpage with the "img" tag
- How to use some different header tags. E.g "h1", "h2"
- How to use "p" tag to display paragraph texts
- How to use "ol" and "ul" with "li" to list items in an ordered/unordered way
